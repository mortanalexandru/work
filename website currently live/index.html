        						content : '<ul><li>UX, or User Experience design evolved from physical product design and has become increasingly important in the world of digital products and services. It is an end to end process that includes all aspects of the end-user’s interactions with your service or product. A philosophy that guides everything from helping a business to understand what they can and want to achieve with their product, to understanding who your users actually are, what they need and want from the product and all the way to making sure that the look and feel of the graphical user interface fits with your branding.</li>\
        	        <li>Some people confuse UX with Graphic Design. Graphic Design, with its history in print, concentrates on visual communication and is often involved in branding and elements of web design and print material. UX however has become a vital part of the development process for most digital services and software. It shifts the focus to the whole design process and underpins this with a rigorous understanding of both the business and end users. Most importantly though it is understanding how users think and behave to guide the design of your service or product. Through user interviews, usability testing and other research methods, UX design will ensure that your product leaves users satisfied and meets their needs.</li>\
        	        <li>An end to end UX design team will include a number of disciplines that are brought together to provide that coherent whole. This will include User Researchers, who will discover what your users need and help develop the brief; Information Architects, who will design the underlying structure of the data and how this can be best optimised; User Interface Designers, who will ensure an effective and consistent visual interface and branding. Along with others, all of these play an important part in developing your product or service.</li></ul>'

        	        <li>Successful products are simple, but powerful, presenting a cohesive and coherent whole that enables the user to intuitively understand how to interact with the product and achieve what they want. They achieve a balance between enabling the user to access the features they need whilst keeping it easy to use or understand.</li>\
        	        <li>Classic examples of excellent UX design are Apple products and many BBC services such as iPlayer and the BBC news website. Apple in particular are known for being intuitive and easy to use, even to the many people whom have never heard of UX design. This is a vital reason why Apple products sell so well and a powerful example of why every company should pay heed to UX.</li>\

That good design has the ability to keep things simple even when they are complex. As a team we focus on creating meaningful connections between users and their technology, informed by a deep understanding of user interaction and behaviour. Ultimately, we see the power of design as enabling us to change user behaviour.</li> \
