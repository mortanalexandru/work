                content:'<ul><li>UX, or User Experience design evolved from physical product \
                design and has become increasingly important in the world of digital products \
                and services. It is an end to end process that includes all aspects of \
                the end­user’s interactions with your service or product. A philosophy \
                that guides everything from helping a business to understand what \
                they can and want to achieve with their product, to understanding \
                who your users actually are, what they need and want from the product \
                and all the way to making sure that the look and feel of the graphical \
                user interface fits with your branding.</li>\
                <li>Some people confuse UX with Graphic Design. Graphic Design,\
                 with its history in print, concentrates on visual \
                 communication and is often involved in branding and \
                 elements of web design and print material. UX however \
                 has become a vital part of the development process for \
                 most digital services and software. It shifts the focus \
                 to the whole design process and underpins this with a rigorous \
                 understanding of both the business and end users. Most importantly \
                 though it is understanding how users think and behave to guide \
                 the design of your service or product. Through user interviews, \
                 usability testing and other research methods, UX design will ensure \
                 that your product leaves users satisfied and meets their needs.</li>\

                content:'<ul><li>Any app, digital product or service lives or dies by its users. \
                The ability to give a pleasing experience to your users and have them keep coming \
                back is incredibly important. \
                UX design is an integral part of how to achieve this.</li>\
                <li>Successful products are simple, but powerful, presenting a \
                cohesive and coherent whole that enables the user to intuitively \
                understand how to interact with the product and achieve what they want. \
                They achieve a balance between enabling the user to access the features \
                they need whilst keeping it easy to use or understand.</li>\
                <li>Classic examples of excellent UX design are Apple products and \
                many BBC services such as iPlayer and the BBC news website. \
                Apple in particular are known for being intuitive and easy to use, \
                even to the many people whom have never heard of UX design. \
                This is a vital reason why Apple products sell so well and a powerful \
                example of why every company should pay heed to UX.</li>\
